# FIN-514-Final-Project--dispersion-trade
Used dispersion trade method and Vega-neutral strategy to construct a portfolio using GARCH and multivariate FHS models with constant correlations; measured the realized performance of the portfolio based on simulated VaR, Expected Shortfall and certain Greeks letters in various scenarios.


** The data for this project is over 25MB(way over 25MB), it's impossible upload all the data files into github. You can contact me at ruixinzhang970316@gmail.com if you have further interest **

## The Project Contains:
• Obtained the option data from WRDS/Option Metrics (Black Scholes & Binomial tree) and calculated the VaR & Expected
Shortfall of the portfolio using a 21-day(one business month) horizon with Multivariate FHS approach.

• Simulated default times and dealt with multivariate distributions of risk factors using copula functions (Random LGD).
